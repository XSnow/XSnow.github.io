I am a fresh PhD graduate in the [HKUPL Group](https://hkuplg.github.io/) from [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/),
advised by
[Dr. Bruno C. d. S. Oliveira](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/bruno).
I do research about type systems of programming languages.
My [thesis](http://find.lib.hku.hk/record=alma991044649901903414) is about intersection type, union type, and the merge operator.

After spending years on the western part of Hong Kong Island
[(photos)](/blog/2023/film-photo/), I moved
to a small village house in the New Territories with my boyfriend,
Bingchen Gong. Our nights are occasionally filled with BBQs and
hotpots, and recently, we've been playing host to our neighbor's
cat. During my leisure hours, I find joy in cycling along the Shing
Mun River and Tolo Harbour, or simply floating in the sea at Tai Mei Tuk.

Feel free to drop me an email. You may also find me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hxjxsnow/) or [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HXJxSnow/).
